Hey! Thanks for stopping by **Coding Trails**. I’m Matthew Sanner, an early-career software engineer with a background in hospitality, now adapting my people skills to solve problems with programming and technology. 

In my work, I've noticed that many clever projects and niche programming workflows don’t have clear, practical, or reliable documentation online. This site is my attempt to fill in some of those gaps with detailed, human-centered tutorials and guides built from projects I’ve worked on personally- the kind of resources I wish I'd had when I was tackling them.

Beyond tutorials, I’ll occasionally share posts on software design, development workflows, project breakdowns, and reflections from my adventures in code. My approach is always grounded in clarity, usefulness, and making technology approachable.

If that sounds interesting, toss this site in your bookmarks and drop by now and then. Thanks for visiting, see you around!
